    State
        UI State
            Any data that assists in the presentational logic of the Application
            It is highly UNLIKELY that this data is needed in other parts of the application
            OK to maintain this data in the component

        Application State
            Any data that assists in the domain logic of the application
            It is highly LIKELY that this data is needed in other parts of the application
            DO NOT maintain this data in the component
