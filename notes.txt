Building Blocks
    Module
        Logical grouping of angular entities

    Component
        Presentation (template + css)
        UI events
        State

    Directive
        DOM manipulation
        Directive = component without template

    Pipe
        Data transformation for presentation

    Service
        

    State
        UI State
            Any data that assists in the presentational logic of the Application
            It is highly UNLIKELY that this data is needed in other parts of the application
            OK to maintain this data in the component

        Application State
            Any data that assists in the domain logic of the application
            It is highly LIKELY that this data is needed in other parts of the application
            DO NOT maintain this data in the component

MicroFrontEnd
    Create a workspace
        ng new wk-wfe-app --create-application=false

    Create the shell project
        cd wk-wfe-app
        ng g application shell

    Create the mfe project
        cd wk-wfe-app
        ng g application mfe1

    Install the plugin
        In the workspace folder
            npm i  @angular/architects/module-federation -D

    Run the plugin to convert the projects into MicroFrontEnds
        In the workspace folder
            ng g @angular-architects/module-federation --project shell --port 4200 --type host
            ng g @angular-architects/module-federation:init --project mfe1 --port 3200 --type remote

            Update the webpack.config.js file with the updated port numbers

    Serve the mfe1
        ng serve mfe1

    Serve the shell
        ng serve shell

    Modify the routes in the shell to load the MicroFrontEnds
        Example:
            {
                path: 'flights',
                loadChildren: () =>
                    loadRemoteModule({
                        type: 'manifest',
                        remoteName: 'mfe1',
                        exposedModule: './Module',
                    }).then((m) => m.FlightsModule),
            }
